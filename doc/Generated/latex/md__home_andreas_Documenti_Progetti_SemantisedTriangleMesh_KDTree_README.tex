Simple C++ static KD-\/\+Tree implementation with minimal functionality.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item points are given as STL vectors (and inserted in their own STL vector) so supports n-\/dimensional points for any n
\item makes full trees, (i.\+e. does not cut-\/off the branching at some arbitrary level) giving the nearest neighbor query have (strong) logarithmic complexity.
\item builds the tree in one go (does not support adding nodes, the tree is built from a list of points and cannot be altered afterwards)
\item points are assumed to be STL vectors
\item it provides the following queries\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item nearest neighbor
\item neighbors within a given distance
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{md__home_andreas_Documenti_Progetti_SemantisedTriangleMesh_KDTree_README_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysection{License and copyright}\label{md__home_andreas_Documenti_Progetti_SemantisedTriangleMesh_KDTree_README_autotoc_md1}
